<div class="about">
  <h2>about</h2>
  <p>I got my BSc. in Biology from Virginia Tech in 2009. After college, I went on to work with a biological research team at N.C. State University 
  where we studied the life cycle and reproductive strategies of Puerto Rican fish species. Continuing my work in marine/aquatic 
  ecosystems, I moved to Alaska to become a biologist onboard commercial fishing vessels. There, my responsibility was to collect
  data to calculate the health and sustainability of the fisheries in the region. After a few years, stability started to become an
  ever increasing priority to me. So, I started working for Mecklenburg County government in North Carolina as a part of their 
  water quality program. While at Mecklenburg, I dealt with local environmental ordinances and regulations as it applied to both
  civilians and businesses. My experience in aquatic and fish biology was also put to use as I helped work on stream restoration projects and 
  community outreach programs.</p>
  
  <p>While I have a deep passion and curiosity for the natural world that we live in, I have an equally curious fascination in 
  technology. In 2014, I started to take computer science classes, part time, and found that it is something I enjoy a lot. With this
  website I hope to showcase some of things I've learned. Enjoy!</p>
