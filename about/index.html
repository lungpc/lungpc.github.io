<div class="about">
  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I got my BSc in Biology from Virginia Tech in 2009. After college, I went on to work with a biological research team at N.C. State University 
  where we studied life cycle and reproductive strategies in Puerto Rican fish species. I continued to work in marine/aquatic 
  ecosystems as I moved to Alaska to become a biologist onboard commercial fishing vessels. There, my responsibility was to collect
  data to calculate the health and sustainability of the fisheries in the region. After a few years, stability started to become an
  ever increasing priority to me. So, I started working for Mecklenburg County government in North Carolina as a part of their 
  water quality program. While at Mecklenburg, I dealt with the local environmental ordinances and regulations as it applied to both
  civilians and businesses. My experience in aquatic and fish biology was also put to use in the form of restoration projects and 
  community outreach programs.</p>
  
  <p>While I have a deep passion and curiosity for the natural world that we live in, I also have an equally curious and interest in 
  technology. I started to take programming classes, part time, in 2014 and found that it is something that I enjoy a lot. With this
  website I hope to showcase some of things I've learned. Enjoy!</p>
