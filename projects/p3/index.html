<p><a href="https://github.com/lungpc/datastructures-projects/tree/master/CSC316%20Data%20Structures_project3">In this program</a>,
I use Kruskal’s algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree with a 
heap and Up-tree structure. Both of which are implemented using arrays. An adjacency list for
all the vertices is also created to represent the final connected graph.</p>

<p>Kruskal’s is used in graph theory on weighted, connected and unconnected, graphs as a means
of finding a subset of the edges that form a tree, that includes every vertex, where the total 
weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.</p>

<p>The heap, in this case a “min heap”, holds an array of edges, and represents all the vertices 
of the graph. The Up-tree is used to create sets of edges, find disjoint sets, and join disjoint
sets together.</p>

<p>Once the algorthim is done, the program will then output a .txt file of the adjacency list which
is the fully connected graph, represented by a minimum spanning tree. </p>
