<p><a href="https://github.com/lungpc/datastructures-projects/tree/master/CSC316%20Data%20Structures_project3">In this program</a>,
I use Kruskal’s algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree with a 
heap and Up-tree structure. Both of which are implemented using arrays. An adjacency list for
all the vertices is also created to represent the final connected graph.</p>

<p>Kruskal’s is used in graph theory on weighted, connected and unconnected, graphs as a means
of finding a subset of the edges that form a tree, that includes every vertex, where the total 
weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.</p>

<p>The heap, in this case a “min heap”, holds an array of edges, and represents all the vertices 
of the graph. The Up-tree is used to create sets of edges, find disjoint sets, and join disjoint
sets together.</p>

<p>Using the heap, we can always find which the next smallest edge in the forest is. Then, in conjunction with the
Up-tree, it determines whether that edge is a part of the minimum spanning tree. If not,
then the two disjoint sets will be joined together. It repeats until there are no disjoint sets left, and all the 
vertices are a part of a single tree.</p>

<p>The program will then output a .txt file of the adjacency list which is the fully connected graph, represented by
a minimum spanning tree. </p>
