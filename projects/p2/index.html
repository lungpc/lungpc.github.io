<h2>project 2</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lungpc/datastructures-projects/tree/master/CSC316%20Data%20Structures_project2">This program</a> 
outputs a binary search tree consisting of nodes that have an integer key and a String value. 
It is implemented via a linked list structure that models a Dictionary ADT. It requires 2 different input 
.txt files, which are included (smallInput.txt and largeInput.txt), to run and will output 2 different .txt files.</p>

<p>The most critical part of this program is its buildTree(int, int) method. It recursively creates a binary search
tree from the nodes that were created from the input file. Once the tree is built, then it can be manipulated as
the rest of the program calls for (insert and remove operations).</p>

<p>The second input file contains key sequences ordered in different statistical distributions, much like in the first project. 
There are 3 included files, each with a different distribution (geometric, Zipf, and uniform) that can be used.</p>

<p>The last part of the program scans the sequence of keys in the second input file, searches for each key, and 
records how much effort it took to find them.</p>
