<h2>project 2</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lungpc/datastructures-projects/tree/master/CSC316%20Data%20Structures_project2">This program</a> 
outputs a binary search tree consisting of nodes that have an integer key and a String value. 
It is implemented via a linked list structure that models a Dictionary ADT. It also requires 2 different input 
.txt files and will output 2 .txt files. The first input file is used to create a binary search tree. 
The 2 included files (smallInput.txt and largeInput.txt) have key sequences that are divided by a -1. These are
sentinel values, which organize how the tree is created in the performOperations() method. </p>

<p>The most critical part of this program is its buildTree(int, int) method. It recursively creates a binary search
tree from the nodes that were created from the input file. Once the tree is built, then it can be manipulated as
the rest of the program calls for (insert and remove operations).</p>

<p>The second input file contains key sequences order in statistical distributions, much like in the first project. 
There are 3 included files, each with a different distribution (geometric, Zipf, and uniform).</p>

<p>The last part of the program scans the sequence of keys in the second input file, searches for each key, and 
records how much effort it took to find each key.</p>
