<h2>project 1</h2>
<p>This project employs 3 different strategies on a self-implemented linked list structure: 
a binary search, move-to-front (MTF), and transpose operation.</p>

<p>The program requires a .txt input file to run its algorithm. These files are formatted so that 
they contain an integer key with a String value. Iâ€™ve included several of these files for easy testing.
A list, modeling a Dictionary ADT, is created from these key-value pairings.</p>

<p>The sequence in which the key appear in the file are scanned, including duplicates, and a lookUp() 
method is called to find where each key is in our list. The time it takes to do this operation is
calculated and recorded.</p>

<p>In the MTF and transpose strategies, the linked list is traversed linearly until a match is found.
If one is found,and depending on the respective strategy, that node is either moved to the front of 
the list or moved up one spot on the list.</p>

<p>The binary search operation is the only one that does not traverse the list in a linear fashion. It employs a
binary search algorithm where it looks at the middle (n/2) node, where n is the size of the list, and eliminates 
half of the list until it has narrowed down the possible matches to just one. The nodes are not manipulated in this strategy,
just looked at.</p>
