<h2>project 1</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lungpc/datastructures-projects/tree/master/CSC316%20Data%20Structures_Project1">This project</a>
employs 3 different strategies on a self-implemented linked list structure: 
a binary search, move-to-front (MTF), and transpose operation.</p>

<p>The program requires a .txt input file to run its algorithm. These files contain an integer key with a String value. Several 
files are included (Geometric, Uniform, and Zipf) for ease of use. A list, modeling a Dictionary ADT, is created from 
each unique key-value pair.</p>

<p>The sequence in which the keys appear in each file is used to analyze the efficiency of 
each respective search algorithm. The cost of each find operation is calculated and recorded.</p>

<p>In the MTF and transpose strategies, the linked list is traversed linearly until a match is found.
If one is found,and depending on the respective strategy, that node is either moved to the front of 
the list or moved up one spot on the list.</p>

<p>The binary search operation is the only one that does not traverse the list in a linear fashion. It employs a
binary search algorithm where it looks at the middle (n/2) node, where n is the size of the list, and eliminates 
half of the list until it has narrowed down the possible matches to just one. The nodes are not manipulated in this strategy,
just looked at.</p>
