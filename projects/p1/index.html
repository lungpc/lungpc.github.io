<h2>project 1</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lungpc/datastructures-projects/tree/master/CSC316%20Data%20Structures_Project1">This project</a>
employs 3 different strategies on a self-implemented linked list structure: 
a binary search, move-to-front (MTF), and transpose operation.</p>

<p>The program requires a .txt input file to run its algorithm, several of which are included (Geometric, Uniform, and Zipf).
A list, modeling a Dictionary ADT, is created from the file data (integer keys with String values).</p>

<p>The sequence in which the keys appear in each file is used to analyze the efficiency of 
each respective search algorithm. The cost of each find operation is calculated and recorded.</p>

<p>In the MTF and transpose strategies, the linked list is traversed linearly until a match is found.
If one is found,and depending on the respective strategy, that node is either moved to the front of 
the list or moved up one spot on the list.</p>

<p>The binary search operation is the only one that does not traverse the list in a linear fashion. It uses a
binary search algorithm to find each key. The nodes are not manipulated in this strategy, just looked at.</p>
