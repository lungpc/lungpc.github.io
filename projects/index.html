    <h2>projects</h2>
    
    <p>In these repositories, there are 3 separate projects that are exercises in different topics of object oriented programming.</p>

    <a href="/projects/p1">Java/list manipulations</a>
    <p>The first, deals with 3 different strategies to search, traverse, and manipulate a list abstract data type (ADT). 
    These lists are self-implemented linked list structures.</p>

   <p>The next program demonstrates the power of recursion and its effectiveness in doing tasks such as building
   binary tree structures: <a href="/projects/p2">project 2</a>.</p>

    <p>The third project delves into graph theory a little bit. It utilizes many different data structures to create a
    minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm: <a href="/projects/p3">project 3</a>.</p>
