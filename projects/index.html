    <p><a href="/projects/p1">Java/list manipulation</a></p>
    
    <p>This program utilizes 3 different strategies to search, traverse, and manipulate a list. 
    These are self-implemented linked list structures modeling a Dictionary ADT.</p>

   <p><a href="/projects/p2">Java/recursion</a></p>
   
   <p>The next program demonstrates the power of recursion and its effectiveness in doing tasks such as building
   binary tree structures.</p>

    <p><a href="/projects/p3">Java/minimum spanning tree</a></p>
    
    <p>The third project delves into graph theory a little bit. It utilizes many different data structures to create a
    minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.</p>
